# imageuploader

## Angular
There is an angular front end and two different backends in .net 5 and GO

The angular front end can be started with the following commands in the /angular/image-uploader directory (with angular cli installed)
- npm install
- ng serve

the UI should be available on localhost:4200 after building

## GO
The GO api backend can be started with the following commands in the /go directory
- go run cmd/main.go

by default the API will run on localhost:8081 which the UI is already configured to use

## .Net

The .net api backend can be started with the following commands in the /dotnet directory
- dotnet run --project ./ImageUploader.Api/ImageUploader.Api.csproj

by default the API will run on localhost:8081 which the UI is already configured to use
